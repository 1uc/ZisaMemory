# Contributing 
TL;DR Zisa is code, please treat it as such and reuse which ever parts you
find useful. If you like, you can then share the improvements. They'll be well
received.

Zisa has been split into smaller libraries to facilitate code reuse. The
motivation to open-source them is that it might reduce your (or my) development
time in some project. The code has a scientific computing background.
Therefore, you're welcome to contribute changes via issues or pull requests;
and (in true scientific computing fashion) make destructive changes in your own
fork.
